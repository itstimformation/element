        In 1868, Pierre J. C. Janssen travelled to India to measure the solar
        spectrum during a total eclipse and observed a new yellow line which
        indicated a new element. Joseph Norman Lockyer recorded the same line
        by observing the sun through London smog and, assuming the new element
        to be a metal, he named it helium.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1882, the Italian Luigi Palmieri found the same line the spectrum
        of gases emitted by Vesuvius, as did the American William Hillebrand
        in 1889 when he collected the gas given off by the mineral uraninite
        (UO2) as it dissolves in acid. However, it was Per Teodor Cleve and
        Nils Abraham Langer at Uppsala, Sweden, in 1895, who repeated that
        experiment and confirmed it was helium and measured its atomic weight.

    <h2>Biological Role</h2>
    <p class="bio-role">
      Helium has no known biological role. It is non-toxic.

  <div class="box f">
    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p class="uses">
      Helium is used as a cooling medium for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
      and the superconducting magnets in MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers.
      It is also used to keep satellite instruments cool and was used to cool
      the liquid oxygen and hydrogen that powered the Apollo space vehicles.
      <br>
      <br>
      Because of its low density helium is often used to fill decorative
      balloons, weather balloons and airships. Hydrogen was once used to fill
      balloons but it is dangerously reactive.
      <br>
      <br>
      Because it is very unreactive, helium is used to provide an inert
      protective atmosphere for making fibre optics and semiconductors, and
      for arc welding. Helium is also used to detect leaks, such as in car
      air-conditioning systems, and because it diffuses quickly it is used
      to inflate car airbags after impact.
      <br>
      <br>
      A mixture of 80% helium and 20% oxygen is used as an artificial
      atmosphere for deep-sea divers and others working under pressurised
      conditions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Helium-neon gas lasers are used to scan barcodes in supermarket
      checkouts. A new use for helium is a helium-ion microscope that gives
      better image resolution than a scanning electron microscope.

    <h2>Natural Abundance</h2>
    <p class="natural">
      After hydrogen, helium is the second most abundant element in the
      universe. It is present in all stars. It was, and is still being, formed
      from alpha-particle decay of radioactive elements in the Earth. Some of
      the helium formed escapes into the atmosphere, which contains about 5
      parts per million by volume. This is a dynamic balance, with the low-density
      helium continually escaping to outer space.
      <br>
      <br>
      It is uneconomical to extract helium from the air. The major source
      is natural gas, which can contain up to 7% helium."
