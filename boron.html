      <p class="history">
        For centuries the only source of borax, Na2B2O5(OH)4, was the
        crystallized deposits of Lake Yamdok Cho, in Tibet. It was used as a
        flux used by goldsmiths.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1808, Louis-Josef Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Thénard working in
        Paris, and Sir Humphry Davy in London, independently extracted boron
        by heating borax with potassium metal. In fact, neither had produced
        the pure element which is almost impossible to obtain. A purer type of
        boron was isolated in 1892 by Henri Moissan. Eventually, E. Weintraub
        in the USA produced totally pure boron by sparking a mixture of boron
        chloride, BCl3 vapour, and hydrogen. The material so obtained boron was
        found to have very different properties to those previously reported.

    <h2>Biological Role</h2>
    <p class="bio-role">
      Boron is essential for the cell walls of plants. It is not considered
      poisonous to animals, but in higher doses it can upset the body’s
      metabolism. We take in about 2 milligrams of boron each day from our
      food, and about 60 grams in a lifetime. Some boron compounds are being
      studied as a possible treatment for brain tumours.

  <div class="box f">
    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p class="uses">
      Amorphous boron is used as a rocket fuel igniter and in pyrotechnic
      flares. It gives the flares a distinctive green colour.
      <br>
      <br>
      The most important compounds of boron are boric (or boracic) acid, borax
      (sodium borate) and boric oxide. These can be found in eye drops, mild
      antiseptics, washing powders and tile glazes. Borax used to be used to
      make bleach and as a food preservative.
      <br>
      <br>
      Boric oxide is also commonly used in the manufacture of borosilicate
      glass (Pyrex). It makes the glass tough and heat resistant. Fibreglass
      textiles and insulation are made from borosilcate glass.
      <br>
      <br>
      Sodium octaborate is a flame retardant.
      <br>
      <br>
      The isotope boron-10 is good at absorbing neutrons. This means it can be
      used to regulate nuclear reactors. It also has a role in instruments
      used to detect neutrons.

    <h2>Natural Abundance</h2>
    <p class="natural">
      Boron occurs as an orthoboric acid in some volcanic spring waters, and as
      borates in the minerals borax and colemanite. Extensive borax deposits
      are found in Turkey. However, by far the most important source of boron
      is rasorite. This is found in the Mojave Desert in California, USA.
      <br>
      <br>
      High-purity boron is prepared by reducing boron trichloride or tribromide
      with hydrogen, on electrically heated filaments. Impure, or amorphous,
      boron can be prepared by heating the trioxide with magnesium powder.
