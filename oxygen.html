      <p class="history">
        In 1608, Cornelius Drebbel had shown that heating saltpetre
        (potassium nitrate, KNO3) released a gas. This was oxygen although
        it was not identified as such.
        <br>
        <br>
        The credit for discovering oxygen is now shared by three chemists: an
        Englishman, a Swede, and a Frenchman. Joseph Priestley was the first
        to publish an account of oxygen, having made it in 1774 by focussing
        sunlight on to mercuric oxide (HgO), and collecting the gas which came
        off. He noted that a candle burned more brightly in it and that it made
        breathing easier. Unknown to Priestly, Carl Wilhelm Scheele had
        produced oxygen in June 1771. He had written an account of his
        discovery but it was not published until 1777. Antoine Lavoisier also
        claimed to have discovered oxygen, and he proposed that the new gas be
        called oxy-gène, meaning acid-forming, because he thought it was the
        basis of all acids.

    <h2>Biological Role</h2>
    <p class="bio-role">
      Oxygen first appeared in the Earth’s atmosphere around 2 billion years
      ago, accumulating from the photosynthesis of blue-green algae.
      Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun to split water into oxygen and
      hydrogen. The oxygen passes into the atmosphere and the hydrogen joins
      with carbon dioxide to produce biomass.
      <br>
      <br>
      When living things need energy they take in oxygen for respiration. The
      oxygen returns to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.
      <br>
      <br>
      Oxygen gas is fairly soluble in water, which makes aerobic life in
      rivers, lakes and oceans possible.

  <div class="box f">
    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p class="uses">
      The greatest commercial use of oxygen gas is in the steel industry.
      Large quantities are also used in the manufacture of a wide range of
      chemicals including nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. It is also used
      to make epoxyethane (ethylene oxide), used as antifreeze and to make
      polyester, and chloroethene, the precursor to PVC.
      <br>
      <br>
      Oxygen gas is used for oxy-acetylene welding and cutting of metals. A
      growing use is in the treatment of sewage and of effluent from industry.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box g">
    <h2>Natural Abundance</h2>
    <p class="natural">
      Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere by volume. This is halfway between
      17% (below which breathing for unacclimatised people becomes difficult)
      and 25% (above which many organic compounds are highly flammable). The
      element and its compounds make up 49.2% by mass of the Earth’s crust,
      and about two-thirds of the human body.
      <br>
      <br>
      There are two key methods used to obtain oxygen gas. The first is by
      the distillation of liquid air. The second is to pass clean, dry air
      through a zeolite that absorbs nitrogen and leaves oxygen. A newer
      method, which gives oxygen of a higher purity, is to pass air over a
      partially permeable ceramic membrane.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the laboratory it can be prepared by the electrolysis of water or
      by adding a manganese(IV) oxide catalyst to aqueous hydrogen peroxide.
