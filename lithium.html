      <p class="history">
        The first lithium mineral petalite, LiAlSi4O10, was discovered on the
        Swedish island of Utö by the Brazilian, Jozé Bonifácio de Andralda e
        Silva in the 1790s. It was observed to give an intense crimson flame
        when thrown onto a fire. In 1817, Johan August Arfvedson of Stockholm
        analysed it and deduced it contained a previously unknown metal, which
        he called lithium. He realised this was a new alkali metal and a
        lighter version of sodium. However, unlike sodium he was not able
        to separate it by electrolysis. In 1821 William Brande obtained a
        tiny amount this way but not enough on which to make measurements.
        It was not until 1855 that the German chemist Robert Bunsen and the
        British chemist Augustus Matthiessen obtained it in bulk by the
        electrolysis of molten lithium chloride.

    <h2>Uses</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="box h">
    <p class="uses">
      The most important use of lithium is in rechargeable batteries for
      mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and electric vehicles. Lithium
      is also used in some non-rechargeable batteries for things like heart
      pacemakers, toys and clocks.
      <br>
      <br>
      Lithium metal is made into alloys with aluminium and magnesium, improving
      their strength and making them lighter. A magnesium-lithium alloy is
      used for armour plating. Aluminium-lithium alloys are used in aircraft,
      bicycle frames and high-speed trains.
      <br>
      <br>
      Lithium oxide is used in special glasses and glass ceramics. Lithium
      chloride is one of the most hygroscopic materials known, and is used
      in air conditioning and industrial drying systems (as is lithium bromide).
      Lithium stearate is used as an all-purpose and high-temperature lubricant.
      Lithium carbonate is used in drugs to treat manic depression, although
      its action on the brain is still not fully understood. Lithium hydride
      is used as a means of storing hydrogen for use as a fuel.

    <h2>Natural Abundance</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="box j">
    <p class="natural">
      Lithium does not occur as the metal in nature, but is found combined in
      small amounts in nearly all igneous rocks and in the waters of many
      mineral springs. Spodumene, petalite, lepidolite, and amblygonite are
      the more important minerals containing lithium.
      <br>
      <br>
      Most lithium is currently produced in Chile, from brines that yield
      lithium carbonate when treated with sodium carbonate. The metal is
      produced by the electrolysis of molten lithium chloride and potassium
      chloride.
