  <div class="history">
    <p class="history">
      Mendeleev said there should be an element like caesium waiting to be
      discovered. Consequently, there were claims, denials, and counterclaims
      by scientists who said they had found it. During the 1920s and 30s,
      these claims were made on the basis of unexplained radioactivity in
      minerals, or new lines in their X-ray spectra, but all eventually turned
      out not to be evidence of element 87.
      <br>
      <br>
      Francium was finally discovered in 1939 by Marguerite Perey at the
      Curie Institute in Paris. She had purified a sample of actinium free
      of all its known radioactive impurities and yet its radioactivity
      still indicated another element was present, and which she rightly
      deduced was the missing element 87. Others challenged her results
      too, and it was not until after World War II that she was accepted
      as the rightful discoverer in 1946.

  <div class="box j">

    <p class="natural">
      Francium is obtained by the neutron bombardment of radium in a nuclear
      reactor. It can also be made by bombarding thorium with protons.
