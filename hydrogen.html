      <p class="history">
        In the early 1500s the alchemist Paracelsus noted that the bubbles
        given off when iron filings were added to sulfuric acid were flammable.
        In 1671 Robert Boyle made the same observation. Neither followed up
        their discovery of hydrogen, and so Henry Cavendish gets the credit.
        In 1766 he collected the bubbles and showed that they were different
        from other gases. He later showed that when hydrogen burns it forms
        water, thereby ending the belief that water was an element. The gas
        was given its name hydro-gen, meaning water-former, by Antoine Lavoisier.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1931, Harold Urey and his colleagues at Columbia University in the
        US detected a second, rarer, form of hydrogen. This has twice the mass
        of normal hydrogen, and they named it deuterium.

    <h2>Biological Role</h2>
    <p class="bio-role">
      Hydrogen is an essential element for life. It is present in water and in
      almost all the molecules in living things. However, hydrogen itself does
      not play a particularly active role. It remains bonded to carbon and
      oxygen atoms, while the chemistry of life takes place at the more active
      sites involving, for example, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box f">
    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <p class="uses">
      Some see hydrogen gas as the clean fuel of the future – generated from
      water and returning to water when it is oxidised. Hydrogen-powered fuel
      cells are increasingly being seen as ‘pollution-free’ sources of energy
      and are now being used in some buses and cars.
      <br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen also has many other uses. In the chemical industry it is used to
      make ammonia for agricultural fertiliser (the Haber process) and
      cyclohexane and methanol, which are intermediates in the production of
      plastics and pharmaceuticals. It is also used to remove sulfur from fuels
      during the oil-refining process. Large quantities of hydrogen are used to
      hydrogenate oils to form fats, for example to make margarine.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the glass industry hydrogen is used as a protective atmosphere for
      making flat glass sheets. In the electronics industry it is used as a
      flushing gas during the manufacture of silicon chips.
      <br>
      <br>
      The low density of hydrogen made it a natural choice for one of its
      first practical uses – filling balloons and airships. However, it reacts
      vigorously with oxygen (to form water) and its future in filling airships
      ended when the Hindenburg airship caught fire.

    <h2>Natural Abundance</h2>
    <p class="natural">
      Hydrogen is easily the most abundant element in the universe. It is found
      in the sun and most of the stars, and the planet Jupiter is composed
      mostly of hydrogen.
      <br>
      <br>
      On Earth, hydrogen is found in the greatest quantities as water. It is
      present as a gas in the atmosphere only in tiny amounts – less than 1
      part per million by volume. Any hydrogen that does enter the atmosphere
      quickly escapes the Earth’s gravity into outer space.
      <br>
      <br>
      Most hydrogen is produced by heating natural gas with steam to form
      syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide). The syngas is separated
      to give hydrogen. Hydrogen can also be produced by the electrolysis of
      water.
